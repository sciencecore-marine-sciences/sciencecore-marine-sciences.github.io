Hi Wilson and James,

Yeah, sorry I should have sent it earlier.  I thought I did something wrong before, but it looks like the bad results were just because of the river loads.  

The TP model did not need modification, although I did modify the code by cleaning up garbage.  (Garbage == stuff I originally left in to minimize modifying the code but now is confusing.)

Let me do a final check, and write up the changes from last time, before I send it.  I think I can have that by today, if I don't find anything weird.

Thanks,
Lisa
