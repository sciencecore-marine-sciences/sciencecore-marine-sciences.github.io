# About the Notebooks

These pages display the content, code, and code results from a Notebook.

To run the lab interactively, click the "launch binder" button to open the Notebook in JupyterLab. [More on Jupyter](https://jupyter.org)

Be patient, it might take some time. It is starting up a VM (little computer in the cloud), installing all the necessary Python packages, and loading the data...and all for free!  [More on Binder](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html)

## Work in progress
We are waiting until a lab is somewhat polished before posting it live.  As a consequence, the labs are not sequential in topic or difficulty.  For this reason, we include the Lab number as they appear on our syllabus.  As you can see, the heat flux lab is quite a jump from the Python intro.

Please ask questions or give feedback by clicking the GitHub icon the top of the page and selecting **Open issue**.
