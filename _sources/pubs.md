# Summary 

Our objective is to collect the information needed to reproduce two articles:

Physical Oceanography
- combining field data with satellite data to understand the sea surface temperature conditions associated with a hurricane undergoing rapid intensification over the continental shelf{cite}`HurricaneSally2020ShiftstheOceanThermalStructureacrosstheInnerCoreduringRapidIntensificationovertheShelf`

Biogeochemistry
- using locally calibrated satellite products to improve the satellite estimation of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in coastal waters{cite}`LE2019115`

## A work in progress

In keeping with OSSI, we are sharing *as early as possible*. These materials are in development, and we will continually be adding bits and pieces the moment weâ€™re reasonably sure they will be useful to someone finding them.

Not much to see yet? Please come back and visit us again soon!
