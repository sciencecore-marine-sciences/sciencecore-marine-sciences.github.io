# ScienceCore: Marine Sciences

Many research articles conclude by saying, “this methodology may be used in other systems”, but for any given article, how long would it take not only to reproduce the results but to use that knowledge to make new discoveries?

As part of NASA's [Open-Source Science Initiative(OSSI)](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview), we aim to share our 'hidden knowledge' to lower the computational barriers of entry for students and researchers in marine sciences by teaming up experts in physical oceanography and marine biogeochemistry with a high-performance computing and scientific visualization specialist.  [Meet the team](tops-team)

## Objective 

Using existing research products as a starting point, we will develop:
1. An open-source computational component to a marine sciences lab
2. Online, interactive tutorials that lower the learning curve for using satellite data
3. A recipe for transforming a traditional workflow into an open one

## Under construction
In keeping with OSSI:
> Open-source science is a commitment to the open sharing...*as early as possible in the scientific process*.

We are sharing early and often. These materials are in development, and we will continually be adding bits and pieces the moment we're reasonably sure they will be useful to someone finding them.

Not much to see yet?  Please come back and visit us again soon!

## We're here to help

We want to make computational tasks easy, so you can focus on your science.  As we build these materials, we invite you to try things out.  If something isn't clear or you are having difficulty doing the tasks described, then we have not achieved our goal.  Please reach out for help if you have questions.  As part of NASA's Transform to Open Science Training(TOPST)(https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science) initiative, we have dedicated (human) resources to help you with your goals.  Thanks NASA!
