# What went wrong? 

## Best track
Here's an example of how simple things go wrong:
- When following the video to create written instructions, I got two CloudFront errors.  CloudFront is AWS's content delivery network(CDN). The error message is listed below.  I had to 'Try again later'.
- The first draft of this page included the actual links to the NHC and HURDAT, but when testing, I found the links worked if I typed them in the browser or used Google, but they were blocked when clicking from my draft website.  

The CloudFront error was:
```
421 ERROR
The request could not be satisfied.
The distribution does not match the certificate for which the HTTPS connection was established with. 
We can't connect to the server for this app or website at this time. There might be too much traffic 
or a configuration error. Try again later, or contact the app or website owner.
If you provide content to customers through CloudFront, you can find steps to troubleshoot and help 
prevent this error by reviewing the CloudFront documentation.
